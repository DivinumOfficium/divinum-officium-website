On the morrow we keep the feast of the holy Confessor Gilbert, founder of the Order of Sempringham, of whom mention hath been made upon the 4th day of this present month of February. Likewise on the morrow we keep the feast of the Seven holy Founders of the Order of Servants of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who after great hardship of life, famous for works and wonders, died a death precious in the sight of the Lord, upon Monte Senario, in Tuscany.
