[Lectio5]
Whither came the Emperor Constantine the Great upon the eighth day after his~
Baptism, and, taking off his crown, cast himself down upon the ground, and wept~
abundantly. Then presently he took a spade and pick-axe, and began to break up~
the earth, whereof he carried away twelve baskets-full in honour of the twelve~
Apostles, and built a Church upon that spot, appointed for the Cathedral Church~
of the Prince of the Apostles. This Church was hallowed by holy Pope Silvester~
upon the 18th day of November, in like manner as he had hallowed the Church of~
the Lateran upon the 9th day of the same month. In this Church did the Pope set~
up an altar of stone, and pour ointment thereon, and ordain that from~
thenceforth no altars should be set up, save of stone. The same Emperor~
Constantine likewise built a very stately Church upon the road to Ostia, in~
honour of the holy Apostle Paul, which Church also was hallowed by the blessed~
Silvester. These Churches the Emperor enriched by grants of much land, and~
adorned with exceedingly rich gifts.

The Church of St Peter upon the Vatican fell in course of time to ruins, and~
having been rebuilt from the foundations, enlarged and garnished, by the zeal of~
many Popes, was solemnly consecrated anew by Urban VIII., upon the same day, in~
the year 1628. The Church of St Paul upon the road to Ostia was almost entirely~
consumed by fire in the year 1823, but was rebuilt in a more splendid form and,~
as it were, raised from the dead, by the unwearied zeal of four successive~
Popes. In the year 1854 Pius IX. seized the happy occasion when the doctrine~
concerning the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, which he had just set~
forth, had drawn together to Rome a great multitude of Cardinals and Bishops~
from all quarters of the Catholic world, solemnly to dedicate this new Church in~
their presence upon the 10th day of December in the year aforesaid; but he~
decreed that the yearly Feast in honour of that dedication should be kept upon~
this day, being the same as that of the Dedication of the Church of St Peter.
