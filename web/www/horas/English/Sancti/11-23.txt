Clement, a Roman and disciple of blessed Peter, assigned each of the seven~
districts of the City to a notary who was to investigate carefully the~
sufferings of the Martyrs and their deeds and to write them down. He himself~
wrote a great deal to explain the Christian religion rightly for the salvation~
of others. Because he was converting many to the faith of Christ by his teaching,~
and the holiness of his life, he was exiled by the emperor Trajan to the~
wilderness near the city of Cherson across the Black Sea. There, he found two~
thousand Christians who had been similarly condemned by the emperor. When he had~
converted many nonbelievers in that region to the faith of Christ, at the~
command of the same emperor he was cast into the sea with an anchor tied to his~
neck, and won the crown of martyrdom. His body was later brought to Rome by Pope~
Nicholas I and honorably buried in the Church which had already been dedicated~
to him.

[Ant 3]
Lord, * Thou hast given unto thy Martyr Clement a tabernacle in the sea, after~
the fashion of a temple of marble, builded by the hands of Angels. And Thou~
givest a way thither unto the people on the land, that they may tell of thy~
marvellous works.
