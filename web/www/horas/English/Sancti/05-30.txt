Pope Felix I. was a Roman who ruled the Church in the days of the Emperor~
Aurelian. His father's name was Constantius. His is the ordinance which commands~
that Mass should be celebrated on the monuments and graves of martyrs. He held~
two December ordinations, wherein he ordained nine Priests, five Deacons, and~
five Bishops for divers places. Having finished his testimony he was buried upon~
the Aurelian Way, in the Church which he had himself built and dedicated. He~
lived as Pope two years, four months, and twenty-nine days.
